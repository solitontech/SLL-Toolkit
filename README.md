# SLL-Toolkit
Collection of useful general purpose LabVIEW Reusables.
LabVIEW Version : 2016 (32-bit)

Some of these useful general purpose LabVIEW reusables are:

# SLL Queued State Machine
A simple, straight forward Queue Based State Machine VI Template. Since this is just a single VI, they can be used for any purpose - from a dialog to a simple application.

# SLL File IO
## Write/Read Spreadsheet File
The LabVIEW built-in method does not support multi-line strings and delimiters as part of cell contents. Write and Read to Spreadsheet file adds support for delimiters and multi-line strings as part of cell contents. This is similar to how applications like Excel support multiline strings in CSV file.

## CSV Logger
CSV Logger with support for dynamically adding new headers during logging. Whenver the logger encounters a new header, it takes care of adding the new header without rewriting the entire file contents.

# SLL Easy TCP
SLL Easy TCP takes care of establishing and maintaining connections across any number of TCP clients. Any message received from the client is sent as a user event to the server.

# SLL Debug
## Variant Pop Up
Allows showing any data type (like a cluster) as a message pop up.
## Add Error Meta
Allows to add additional details to the error wire.
## Time Profile Logger
Useful for profiling different parts of code to a file. This takes care of storing the log data in memory till "Close" command is called, so that logging to file won't affect the time profiling.

# SLL Scripting
## Class DVR API Generator
Generates DVR based APIs for LabVIEW Class Methods.
## Project Save As
Make a copy of the project and rename some of the components of the project including their relinking.
## Compare VI Folders
Compare two folders containing VIs to identify modified VIs ignoring cosmetic changes.
## Launch VI in Project Instance
Launches the VI in the given project path's instance.

# SLL String
## Alpha Numeric Sort 1D Array
Alpha Numeric Sorting of 1D String Array so that strings are ordered like File 1, File 2..File 10 instead of the usual sorting like File 1, File 10, File 2..

# SLL Tools
## Add Copyright
A small tool to set/update copyright text to LabVIEW files in a folder.
